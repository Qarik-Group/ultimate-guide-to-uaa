# Upstream Issues

This book is a WIP, and whilst writing it various pull requests or issues were raised on upstream projects. To help track their status I'll try to track them all here:

## Example applications

The [ultimate-guide-to-uaa-examples](https://github.com/starkandwayne/ultimate-guide-to-uaa-examples) project documents its own set of upstream pull requests/branches. Once they are merged these applications will need to update their own dependencies.

## [realworld-examples.md](/realworld-examples/#bosh-cli)

* `bucc uaa` command is available in the next release of BUCC after v0.5.0. [[bucc#136](https://github.com/starkandwayne/bucc/pull/136/files)]
